## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)**: Navigate to the [Security Tab](https://github.com/SteveShi/QuickRecorder/security) of this repository and click **"Report a vulnerability"**.
2. **Email**: If you prefer direct email or cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, contact [xuanlian@mac.com](mailto:xuanlian@mac.com).

### Information to Include

To help us triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Affected version(s) and environment details (macOS version, Xcode version, architecture).
- Clear, reproducible step-by-step instructions or a minimal Proof of Concept (PoC).

## Response Process

- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess severity.
- **Fix & Disclosure**: We will prepare a security patch and coordinate a coordinated disclosure or release notes update. Please allow reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.

## Privacy & Media Security

- **Strict Permission Handling**: Screen and system audio recording relies on Apple's native ScreenCaptureKit APIs with full TCC permission controls.
- **Zero Telemetry**: Media streams are processed entirely locally and written directly to chosen disk destinations with zero outbound telemetry.
